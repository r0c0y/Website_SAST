## üå≥ Branching Guidelines

We follow a consistent naming convention for branches. Always create your work on a new branch, never directly on `main` or `master`.

| Branch Type | Prefix | Description | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Feature** | `feat/` | New features or significant additions. | `feat/add-dark-mode-toggle` |
| **Fix** | `fix/` | Bug fixes. | `fix/header-alignment-on-mobile` |
| **Docs** | `docs/` | Documentation changes (README, guides, etc.). | `docs/update-contributing-guide` |
| **Chore** | `chore/` | Maintenance tasks, config changes, package updates. | `chore/update-dependencies` |

**To create a new branch:**

```bash
git checkout -b <branch-type/descriptive-name>
```

-----

## ‚úçÔ∏è Commit Guidelines

We encourage the use of **Conventional Commits** to keep the history clean, readable, and easy to parse for automatic changelog generation.

Your commit message should be structured as follows: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`

  * **Type:** Must be one of the prefixes listed in the Branching Guidelines (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, etc.).
  * **Scope (Optional):** The part of the codebase affected (e.g., `api`, `ui`, `server`).
  * **Description:** A concise, imperative, lower-case description (no period).

**Good Examples:**

  * `feat: add user authentication component`
  * `fix(server): prevent crash when fetching data`
  * `docs: update installation instructions`

**To commit your changes:**

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: your concise commit message here"
```

## üì§ Pull Request (PR) Steps

Once you've committed your changes, follow these steps to submit your contribution:

1.  **Push Your Branch:** Push your local branch to your forked repository on GitHub:
    ```bash
    git push origin <your-branch-name>
    ```
2.  **Open a Pull Request:** Navigate to your forked repository on GitHub. You should see a prompt to create a Pull Request from your pushed branch.
3.  **Title and Description:**
      * **Title:** Use a concise, descriptive title, often matching your main commit message (e.g., `feat: Add dark mode toggle`).
      * **Description:**
          * Explain the *why* behind the change.
          * Provide steps to test or reproduce the issue/feature.
          * **Link to any related issues** using keywords like `Closes #123`, `Fixes #45`, or `Resolves #789`. This is crucial for tracking\!
4.  **Review:** Wait for a maintainer to review your PR. They may request changes. Respond kindly and make the requested adjustments by committing more changes to the **same branch**.
